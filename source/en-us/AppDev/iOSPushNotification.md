![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/29.png)
 
 
## 3. Modify the code of UIConfig.json

Fill in jpush_app_key, and set push_type to 1, indicating that Jiguang push notification is selected. Then fill in the values of app_id, app_secret, and product_key of the Gizwits application that is bound to Jiguang push notification.

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/30.png)

## 4. Configure push notification in XCode

Open the project, select Targets -> Capabilities, and turn on the Push Notifications button, which enables the project remote push functionality.

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/31.png)
 
After the button is turned on, an .entitlements file is automatically generated, as shown below, where the value in the red box indicates the push environment. Development indicates the development environment, and distribution indicates the production environment. When the value is set to development, push notification only takes effect in the development environment. When it is distribution, push notification takes effect only in the production environment.

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/32.png)

## 5. Start the virtual device

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/33.png)

## 6. Run the APP

Through the above steps, the App is equipped with Jiguang push notification function. After being deployed to a mobile phone, register a user and login in, then bind the cloud virtual device by scanning its QR code.

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/34.png)

## 7. Test push notification

Restart the virtual device to see whether your phone receives a push message.

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/35.png)

## 8. Customize the push notification sound of Jiguang

The D3 Engine supports setting the push notification sound for each rule. Generally it needs to update two places.

### 8.1 Configure push notification sound

Open a push notification rule as follows:

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/36.png)

Select the push for App box (which is in red box above):

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/37.png)

Click "Show JSON sample":

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/38.png)

The sample detail is as follows:

```
{
  "baidu": {
    "aps": {
      "badge": 0,
      "sound": "default"
    },
    "notification_builder_id": 0,
    "notification_basic_style": 0
  },
  "jiguang": {
    "ios": {
      "sound": "sound.caf",
      "badge": 1
    },
    "android": {
      "builder_id": 0,
      "alert_type": 1,
      "style": 1
    }
  }
}
```

Here we use Jiguang push notification. If the sound name is pushMusic.caf, the Advanced Parameter field need to be filled in as follows:

```
{
  "jiguang": {
    "ios": {
      "sound": "pushMusic.caf",
      "badge": 1
    }
  }
}
```

See below:

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/39.png)

Click "OK" to save and complete the settings.

Note: The "badge" parameter is for the content of App Badge. When it is set to 1, the App that receives push notifications displays 1. But in general, the App that receives multiple push notifications will automatically accumulate the Badge number. If "badge" parameter is set to 1, no matter how many notifications are pushed, the Badge number will always be 1.

If you want the App to accumulate the number of received messages, remove "badge": 1. That means if it is not set, it will do the cumulative operation by default.

8.2 Import push notification sound file to project

After D3 Engine successfully configures the custom push notification sound, whenever a notification message is sent to the App, the system will first go to the App to find out whether there is a sound file with the relevant name. If there is, then the sound is played. If not, then play the default system sound.

The audio format of the push notification sound includes aiff, wav, and caf, and the playback time must be within 30 seconds. The file must also be placed in the mainBundle directory of the App. If any one of the above conditions is not met, the system will play the default notification sound instead.

Import an audio file to the project as follows:

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/40.png)

At this point, the configuration of push notification sound is completed. The App will play the audio after receiving a notification message.

# Quick integration with Baidu push notification

## 1. Apply for Baidu API KEY

### 1.1 Create a Baidu application

Go to Baidu cloud push notification platform: http://push.baidu.com, create an application and configure required certificates.

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/41.png)

As shown above, you need to upload the development certificate and production certificate in the pem format.

### 1.2 Apply for Apple Certification

The process of applying for the cer certificate and its exporting is described in section 1.2 of "Quick integrated with Jiguang push notification". The following figure shows how to export the pem certificate from the p12 certificate.

# FAQ

## 1. Need I request to access D3 Engine to use push notification?

Answer: Yes, D3 Engine currently only targets at enterprise developers. Therefore, only enterprise developers can request to access it.

## 2. I completed the above steps using Jiguang push notification, but cannot receive the expected push notification.

Answer:

Step 1: Check whether the XCode push notification switch is enabled. For details, see 2.4 Configure push notification in XCode.
 
Step 2: Check whether the key value of the project .entitlements file matches the current test environment. Distribution represents the production environment,Development represents the development environment.

Step 3: Determine if the Bundle ID of the project is the same as the Bundle ID of the certificate.

Note: If using Baidu push notification, you also need to check whether the pushMode value of the App launch interface is consistent with the current test environment. For details, see “4. Modify the App launch interface for Baidu push notification” in Quick integration with Baidu push notification.

If after the above three steps, it still cannot be pushed, you need to verify the problem on the push notification platform.

Step 4: Log in to the Jiguang/Baidu push notification platform, and test whether the push notification from the platform can reach the App.

For the case of being unable to push from the platform:

1) Check whether the certificate has expired. Consider replacing the certificate.

For the case of being able to push from the platform:

1) Confirm whether the push environment set on Gizwits D3 Engine is consistent with the current test environment, as shown in the "Certificate Type" below.

2) Confirm whether the push notification APPID and Secret bound to the Gizwits application match those used in the App, as shown below.

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/53.png)

3) If it still fails, insert a breakpoint in the following figure. Then print the result value, and determine the specific error code. Diagnose and fix the issue according to the error code hints.

![iOS Push Notification](../../../assets/en-us/AppDev/AppFrame/ios/push/54.png)

Usually result is wrong, it needs to confirm further from the code shown in the figure below.
